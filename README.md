# Plubload
upload large files

I worked on this for 3 days to get it to actually word to upload any size files to your site for free.  If anyone can help check if file is
already on server alert the user to rename the file.  I figured out a way to auto rename but don't want it that way.  Left it to
upload only one file but you can change it to upload as many files you want.
